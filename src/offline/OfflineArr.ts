  `And I love it when you watch me sleep
  You spin me 'round so I can breathe
  It's only safe for you and me
  I know you won't let me OD
  And if I finally die in peace
  Just wrap my body in these sheets
  And pour out the gasoline
  It don't mean much to me
  It's five AM, I'm nihilist
I know there's nothing after this (after this)
Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness (hopelessness)
The only thing I understand
Is zero sum of tenderness (tenderness)
Oh, baby, please just hold me close
Make me believe there's more to live

  `My darkest hours
  Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
  Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you
  I turned into the man I used to be, to be
  Put myself to sleep
  Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
  Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
  I just wanted to call you and say, and say
  Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
  I'd give it all just to hold you close
  Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
  Never comin' down, uh
  I was runnin' away from facin' reality, uh
  Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies`,

  `So I love when you call unexpected
  'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
  So I'ma care for you, you, you
  I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

  You're always worth it (You're always worth it)
  And you deserve it (And you deserve it)
  The way you work it (The way you work it)
  'Cause girl you earned it
  Girl you earned it, yeah`,
