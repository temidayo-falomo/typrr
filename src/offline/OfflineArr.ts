  `My darkest hours
  Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
  Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you
  I turned into the man I used to be, to be
  Put myself to sleep
  Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
  Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
  I just wanted to call you and say, and say
  Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
  I'd give it all just to hold you close
  Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
  Never comin' down, uh
  I was runnin' away from facin' reality, uh
  Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies`,

  `So I love when you call unexpected
  'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
  So I'ma care for you, you, you
  I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
  'Cause girl you're perfect, Girl, you're perfect
  You're always worth it, You're always worth it
  And you deserve it
  The way you work it (The way you work it)
  'Cause girl you earned it
  Girl you earned it, yeah
  On that lonely night
You said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it there was only us 
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah

  `The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered consciousness again. 
  Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; 
  and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, 
  but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me. 
  The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door.
   I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. 
   The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet,
    on the bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again.
     The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, 
     I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now. 
  I was surprised that the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them`,
